\section{GUI development (WP6)}

The purpose of this work package is to ensure that when Graphical User Interface will be developed, they will be consistent with Blender User Interface. To do this, we will have to explore the Blender documentation, to see if some written guidelines exist. Otherwise, we will need to get in touch with the Blender community to see if our drafts of GUI will be natural and easy to use by Blender artists.
